Kassi is a service for the OSPN community. We all have our challenges in our daily lives from child care to time management. However, we all also have resources that we may want to share. The idea of this site is to empower our community by making helping each other easier. Here you can lend, rent, give away and sell stuff, give and get help or share rides. Could you lend something to others or help them? Or do you need something yourself? Welcome to Kassi - the place where our community comes together online. Our aim is to develop the site further with your help. So, please sign up, leave a notice, be patient, and give feedback!
