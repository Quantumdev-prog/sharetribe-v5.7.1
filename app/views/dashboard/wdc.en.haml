        Could neighborhoods of big cities be communities where people know each other, do things together and help each other out in various situations? "From Neighborhoods to Village Communities" is a project that brings this spirit to neighborhoods in Helsinki and Lahti with help of modern web technology.
      %p.okl
        The project will focus in three neighborhoods in both cities: Kallio, Pikku Huopalahti and Pitäjänmäki in Helsinki and Ankkuri, Karisto and Mukkula in Lahti. Each district gets their own Sharetribe web community where residents can lend, rent, buy and swap stuff, share rides and help each other out in various ways.
