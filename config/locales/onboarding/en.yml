        filter:
          title: "Step 4: Add fields & filters"
          description_p1: "Filters help your users find what they are looking for. For example, if you sell clothes, you probably want to create a filter for sizes."

          info_image_alt: "A screenshot from payments page"
          setup_payments: "Setup payments"
          advice: "When setting the transaction fee, keep in mind how many transactions you expect, and how high the transactions are on average. At the same time, keep it at an acceptable rate for your suppliers and customers. If you expect a high frequency of small transactions, you could set a low % and a low minimum fee, while a marketplace with less frequent, higher priced transactions, should probably do the opposite."
